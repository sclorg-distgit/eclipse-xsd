-<h2>Eclipse Public License - v 1.0</h2>
-
-<p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
-PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR
-DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
-AGREEMENT.</p>
-
-<p><b>1. DEFINITIONS</b></p>
-
-<p>&quot;Contribution&quot; means:</p>
-
-<p class="list">a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial
-code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</p>
-<p class="list">b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>
-<p class="list">i) changes to the Program, and</p>
-<p class="list">ii) additions to the Program;</p>
-<p class="list">where such changes and/or additions to the Program
-originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
-Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
-Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
-Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
-Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
-conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)
-are not derivative works of the Program.</p>
-
-<p>&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes
-the Program.</p>
-
-<p>&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a
-Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
-Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</p>
-
-<p>&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance
-with this Agreement.</p>
-
-<p>&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under
-this Agreement, including all Contributors.</p>
-
-<p><b>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</b></p>
-
-<p class="list">a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
-Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
-royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works
-of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
-Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in
-source code and object code form.</p>
-
-<p class="list">b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
-Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
-royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
-offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
-Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
-license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
-Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
-such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
-by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
-combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
-licensed hereunder.</p>
-
-<p class="list">c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor
-grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances
-are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
-patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
-Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
-any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
-or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
-granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
-secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
-example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
-to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
-that license before distributing the Program.</p>
-
-<p class="list">d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it
-has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
-the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</p>
-
-<p><b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b></p>
-
-<p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code
-form under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>
-
-<p class="list">a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this
-Agreement; and</p>
-
-<p class="list">b) its license agreement:</p>
-
-<p class="list">i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors
-all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
-or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
-conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p>
-
-<p class="list">ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors
-all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
-incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p>
-
-<p class="list">iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
-Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
-party; and</p>
-
-<p class="list">iv) states that source code for the Program is available
-from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
-reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
-exchange.</p>
-
-<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>
-
-<p class="list">a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>
-
-<p class="list">b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each
-copy of the Program.</p>
-
-<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
-within the Program.</p>
-
-<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
-Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
-Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>
-
-<p><b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b></p>
-
-<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
-responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
-like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of
-the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial
-product offering should do so in a manner which does not create
-potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor
-includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
-(&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and
-indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;)
-against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;)
-arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
-party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
-acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
-distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
-obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
-relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In
-order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify
-the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
-Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
-Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
-Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
-expense.</p>
-
-<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
-product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
-Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
-claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
-claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
-alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
-defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
-performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
-Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
-must pay those damages.</p>
-
-<p><b>5. NO WARRANTY</b></p>
-
-<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
-PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
-OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
-ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
-OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
-responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
-distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
-exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to
-the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
-damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or
-interruption of operations.</p>
-
-<p><b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b></p>
-
-<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
-NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
-INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
-WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
-LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
-NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
-DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
-HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
-
-<p><b>7. GENERAL</b></p>
-
-<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
-applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
-the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
-by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
-extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>
-
-<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
-(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
-Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
-software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
-Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the
-date such litigation is filed.</p>
-
-<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
-fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
-Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
-after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights
-under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
-distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
-Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by
-Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>
-
-<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
-Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
-copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
-Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including
-revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the
-Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse
-Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may
-assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a
-suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be
-given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
-Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
-Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version
-of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
-Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
-expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
-rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
-this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
-otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
-Agreement are reserved.</p>
-
-<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
-the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party
-to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more
-than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its
-rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>

-<h2>Eclipse Public License - v 1.0</h2>
-
-<p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
-PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR
-DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
-AGREEMENT.</p>
-
-<p><b>1. DEFINITIONS</b></p>
-
-<p>&quot;Contribution&quot; means:</p>
-
-<p class="list">a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial
-code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</p>
-<p class="list">b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>
-<p class="list">i) changes to the Program, and</p>
-<p class="list">ii) additions to the Program;</p>
-<p class="list">where such changes and/or additions to the Program
-originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
-Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
-Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
-Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
-Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
-conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)
-are not derivative works of the Program.</p>
-
-<p>&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes
-the Program.</p>
-
-<p>&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a
-Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
-Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</p>
-
-<p>&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance
-with this Agreement.</p>
-
-<p>&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under
-this Agreement, including all Contributors.</p>
-
-<p><b>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</b></p>
-
-<p class="list">a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
-Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
-royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works
-of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
-Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in
-source code and object code form.</p>
-
-<p class="list">b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
-Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
-royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
-offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
-Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
-license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
-Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
-such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
-by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
-combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
-licensed hereunder.</p>
-
-<p class="list">c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor
-grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances
-are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
-patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
-Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
-any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
-or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
-granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
-secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
-example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
-to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
-that license before distributing the Program.</p>
-
-<p class="list">d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it
-has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
-the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</p>
-
-<p><b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b></p>
-
-<p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code
-form under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>
-
-<p class="list">a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this
-Agreement; and</p>
-
-<p class="list">b) its license agreement:</p>
-
-<p class="list">i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors
-all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
-or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
-conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p>
-
-<p class="list">ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors
-all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
-incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p>
-
-<p class="list">iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
-Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
-party; and</p>
-
-<p class="list">iv) states that source code for the Program is available
-from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
-reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
-exchange.</p>
-
-<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>
-
-<p class="list">a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>
-
-<p class="list">b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each
-copy of the Program.</p>
-
-<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
-within the Program.</p>
-
-<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
-Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
-Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>
-
-<p><b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b></p>
-
-<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
-responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
-like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of
-the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial
-product offering should do so in a manner which does not create
-potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor
-includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
-(&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and
-indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;)
-against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;)
-arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
-party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
-acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
-distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
-obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
-relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In
-order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify
-the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
-Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
-Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
-Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
-expense.</p>
-
-<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
-product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
-Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
-claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
-claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
-alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
-defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
-performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
-Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
-must pay those damages.</p>
-
-<p><b>5. NO WARRANTY</b></p>
-
-<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
-PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
-OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
-ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
-OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
-responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
-distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
-exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to
-the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
-damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or
-interruption of operations.</p>
-
-<p><b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b></p>
-
-<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
-NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
-INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
-WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
-LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
-NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
-DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
-HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
-
-<p><b>7. GENERAL</b></p>
-
-<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
-applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
-the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
-by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
-extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>
-
-<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
-(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
-Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
-software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
-Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the
-date such litigation is filed.</p>
-
-<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
-fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
-Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
-after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights
-under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
-distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
-Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by
-Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>
-
-<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
-Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
-copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
-Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including
-revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the
-Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse
-Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may
-assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a
-suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be
-given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
-Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
-Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version
-of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
-Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
-expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
-rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
-this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
-otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
